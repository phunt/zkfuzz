## Summary

[This project](http://github.com/phunt/zkfuzz) provides a fuzzing utility for ZooKeeper. It is compatible with Python3.

## Example

## What's Apache ZooKeeper?

From the [official site](http://hadoop.apache.org/zookeeper/) "ZooKeeper is a high-performance coordination service for distributed applications."

It exposes common services - such as naming, configuration management, synchronization, and group services - in a simple interface so you don't have to write them from scratch. You can use it off-the-shelf to implement consensus, group management, leader election, and presence protocols.
